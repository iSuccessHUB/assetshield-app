# Production Admin Login Fix

## Current Issue
Cloudflare Pages is deploying commit f655e62 instead of the latest fixed commit.

## Immediate Solution - Environment Variables
Set these environment variables in your Cloudflare Pages dashboard to override the hardcoded values:

### Go to Cloudflare Pages → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables

Add these **Production** environment variables:

```
ADMIN_USERNAME=peter@isuccesshub.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=AdminPass2024!Change
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-change-this-immediately
```

## Alternative Solution - Force Latest Deployment

### Method 1: Manual Deployment
1. Go to Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Select your assetshieldapp.com project  
3. Click "Create deployment"
4. Select "Connect to Git" 
5. Deploy from the latest commit (3ea0ec3)

### Method 2: Check Branch Settings
1. Go to Settings → Builds & deployments
2. Verify "Production branch" is set to `main`
3. Ensure no specific commit hash is configured
4. Trigger a new deployment

## Test After Fix
Try logging in at: https://assetshieldapp.com/admin/login
- Username: peter@isuccesshub.com
- Password: AdminPass2024!Change

The API should return: {"success":true}
