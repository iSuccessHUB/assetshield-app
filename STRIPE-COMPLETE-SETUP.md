---

## 🔧 Step 1: Environment Variables Configuration

### Required Environment Variables in Cloudflare Pages:

```bash
# Stripe API Keys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_secret_key_here
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_publishable_key_here

# Stripe Webhook Secret (get from Step 3 below)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here

# Optional
GOOGLE_ADSENSE_CLIENT=ca-pub-your-adsense-id
```

### How to Set Environment Variables:
1. Go to **Cloudflare Dashboard** → **Pages** → **Your Project**
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add all variables for **Production** environment
4. Click **Save** and **Redeploy**

---

## 🌐 Step 2: Deploy Updated Code to Production

Your code is already pushed to GitHub. To deploy:

1. **Option A: Automatic Deployment**
   - If you have GitHub integration enabled, deployment happens automatically
   - Check Cloudflare Pages dashboard for deployment status

2. **Option B: Manual Deployment**
   ```bash
   # If you have Wrangler CLI access
   npm run build
   wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name assetshieldapp
   ```

---

## 🔗 Step 3: Configure Stripe Webhooks

### 3.1 Create Webhook Endpoint

1. Go to **Stripe Dashboard** → **Developers** → **Webhooks**
2. Click **+ Add endpoint**
3. Set **Endpoint URL**: `https://your-domain.com/stripe-webhooks/webhook`
   - Replace `your-domain.com` with your actual domain
4. Select **Events to send**:
   - ✅ `checkout.session.completed`
   - ✅ `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - ✅ `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.created`
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.updated`
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.deleted`

### 3.2 Get Webhook Secret

1. After creating the webhook, click on it
2. In the **Signing secret** section, click **Reveal**
3. Copy the webhook secret (starts with `whsec_`)
4. Add it to your Cloudflare Pages environment variables as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 3.3 Test Webhook Integration

Visit: `https://your-domain.com/stripe-webhooks/config`

You should see:
```json
{
  "webhook_url": "https://your-domain.com/stripe-webhooks/webhook",
  "events_to_subscribe": [...],
  "description": "AssetShield Platform Webhook Integration"
}
```

## 💳 Step 4: Payment Flow Overview

### What Happens When a Lawyer Purchases:

1. **Customer fills payment form** → Lawyer info collected
2. **"Start 14-Day Trial" clicked** → Stripe checkout opens
3. **Setup fee charged immediately** → Customer pays upfront
4. **Webhook receives event** → `checkout.session.completed`
5. **Subscription created automatically** → 14-day trial, then monthly billing
6. **Platform provisioned** → Automated setup begins
7. **Welcome email sent** → Login credentials delivered

### Payment Structure:
- **Starter**: Pay $5,000 → 14-day trial → $500/month
- **Professional**: Pay $10,000 → 14-day trial → $1,200/month  
- **Enterprise**: Pay $25,000 → 14-day trial → $2,500/month

---

## 🔍 Step 5: Testing & Verification

### 5.1 Test Payment Flow
1. Visit your live site
2. Click any pricing tier
3. Fill out the form
4. Click "Start 14-Day Trial"
5. Complete payment with test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`

### 5.2 Check Stripe Dashboard
- **Payments** → Verify setup fee payment
- **Customers** → Verify customer created
- **Subscriptions** → Verify subscription with 14-day trial
- **Webhooks** → Check webhook events received

### 5.3 Monitor Webhook Logs
Check your Cloudflare Pages function logs for webhook processing:
```
✅ Checkout completed for session: cs_live_...  
🚀 Processing platform setup payment for: [Firm Name]
✅ Subscription created successfully: sub_...
🚀 Provisioning platform for: [Firm Name]
✅ Platform provisioned successfully
```

## 🛠️ Step 6: Platform Provisioning (Optional Enhancement)

The webhook system is ready to handle platform provisioning. To implement:

### 6.1 Database Integration
```typescript
// Add to webhook handler
await c.env.DB.prepare(`
  INSERT INTO law_firms (firm_name, owner_name, owner_email, subscription_tier, status, trial_ends_at)
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
`).bind(
  metadata.firmName,
  metadata.lawyerName, 
  metadata.lawyerEmail,
  metadata.tier,
  'trial_active',
  new Date(Date.now() + 14 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString()
).run()
```

### 6.2 Email Integration
```typescript
// Add email service integration
await sendWelcomeEmail({
  to: metadata.lawyerEmail,
  subject: `Welcome to AssetShield ${metadata.tier}!`,
  template: 'platform_welcome',
  data: {
    firmName: metadata.firmName,
    platformUrl: `https://${subdomain}.assetshield.app`,
    loginCredentials: '...'
  }
})
```
